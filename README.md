# Welcome to Git Fun!

Let's talk a little about [git](https://git-scm.com/docs). Git is a very useful tool for saving code change history, and other things.  

## Git

```
git init
```

`git init` initializes a git repository. What this means is that the program git creates a hidden directory and starts to track changes in the directory you are in.
